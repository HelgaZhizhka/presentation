				<h2>Understanding Agile Methodology</h2>
				<p>Today we're going to explore Agile methodology, a game-changer in the field of product development and
					project
					management. Agile is known as a more flexible alternative to traditional Waterfall model, that often can be
					rigid in the
					face of change.</p>
				<p>To understand why Agile is revolutionary, it's important to look at the Waterfall model first.
					Waterfall is a linear approach to project management where each phase is completed before moving on to the
					next.
					Although this method gives a structured way of organizing work, it hardly adapts to changes, what causes
					delays in
					product delivery.</p>

				<h2>Agile Principles</h2>
				<p>Agile also includes 12 principles, which give further definition to the values</p>
				<ul class="text-medium">
					<li class="fragment fade-up"><i>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous
							delivery of valuable software.</i> This means
						we should always aim to make the customer happy. We can do this by regularly giving them useful software.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-up"><i>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.</i> This means that
						it's okay if the customer changes their mind
						about what they want, even if we're almost done with the project. Changes can actually help the customer, so
						we should
						welcome them.</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-up"><i>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment, trust
							them and support their needs.</i> This means
						we should let excited and driven people lead our projects. We should help them and trust them to do a great
						job.</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-up"><i>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then behave accordingly.</i> This means that we
					should regularly take some time to think about how we can work better. Then, we should make changes based on what we
					know.</li>

				<h2>How to use Agile?</h2>
				<p>There are several frameworks within the Agile methodology, including Scrum and Kanban. Scrum is a highly structured
				framework that breaks down complex projects into manageable 'sprints'. In contrast, Kanban emphasizes continuous
				improvement, and teams use Kanban board to visualize their work.
				Agile methodologies also provide teams with flexibility to adapt to changes and help reduce the overall risk of project
				failure.</p>
